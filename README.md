# The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp

Following along with Dr. Angela Yu's [Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12638830#overview) on Udemy. I'm skipping sections 2-11 on Angela's recommendation since my skills are beyond the level to need that material.

### Top Tips for the Course

1. Each lesson is about 10 minutes. Watch and understand (What is the purpose of the code and why is it being written). Once you understand try to replicate it rather than copying along with the video.
2. Cornell Note Taking System: Topic, notes, keywords/questions to research later, summary in bullets. (See course docs for template)
3. Don't skip any topics, course is built to be gradual improvement. Some videos are labeled as optional and can be skipped.
4. Mark topics for review if you don't understand them. Research and learn more than come back to that topic.
5. Use Google and Stack Overflow to find answers to problems when you're stuck. Struggling is good! This is how we learn.
