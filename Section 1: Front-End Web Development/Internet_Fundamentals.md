# How Does the Internet Work?

* The Internet: A wire connecting computers to each other, data can be transferred over this wire
  * Server: Online all the time, ready to serve files and data accessible through websites (Like a giant library open all the time)
  * Client: Used to access a server
    * Browser sends message to ISP when you access a website. This message then gets passed to a DNS Server (like a giant phone book of IP addresses) --> Every computer on the internet has a unique IP address
      * IP address is returned to the browser and client sends a request directly to that IP, this is sent through the Internet Backbone (wires that connect servers around the world) to the server responsible for the address we are trying to access. This data is then returned to our browser
        * This is all done with the IP address!!

# How do Websites Work?

* We use a browser to access websites through IP addresses
  * Made of HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JS (functionality/behaviour [allows website to actually do things])
